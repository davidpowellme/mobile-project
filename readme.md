##User Story: Finding Schedule Changes and Notifying Team

1. User opens app
2. User sees schedule change
3. User notifies team

###1. User opens app
The user opens the app because of a push notification on their phone alerting them to league schedule changes (rain outs, etc). Tapping the notification takes the user directly to where the scheduling info appears in the app.

###2. User sees schedule change
The app displays the information about the schedule change (ie whether the game will be played in a different location or at a different time) and allows users to confirm they have seen the update and also contact the league commissioners. The CTA will direct them to notify their team members.

###3. User notifies team
Following the CTA takes users to a default message containing the most important details of the update. The user can then add more information if desired or just tap send and be done. The team member's information is stored in a directory in the app, so the message is sent as texts or emails to them.
