##Paper Prototyping
I got Scott and Abby to test my paper prototype. The scenario that the user has opened the app to check for updates on the game. I had the game be canceled and charged them with telling their team about it. 

The "happy path" screenflow went this way:

1. Open app
2. See pop-up immediately informing the user that the game was canceled due to rain and prompting them with a CTA to notify their team.
3. Take to default message.
4. Type additional message if desired.
5. Send default message and additional message to team.

Minimum taps to complete (ideally).

This worked flawlessly after I fixed two bugs:
- At first, I didn't have a keyboard in the message screen.
- Then, I didn't have a "send" button.

The flow works, but only if you take into account every minute detail. Still working on that.
